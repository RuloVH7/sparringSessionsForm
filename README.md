# ü•ä Boxing Course Registration Automation

An automated registration system was developed for boxers interested in a training course or sporting event. Through a smart form, participants submit their personal data and immediately receive:
- A personalized confirmation message
- A PDF with all the event information
- Meanwhile, the organizer receives all participant data in a Google Sheet to keep a real-time list of registered athletes
The entire system is automated and scalable for multiple events.
