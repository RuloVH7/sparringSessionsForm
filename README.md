ðŸ§  Project Summary

An automated registration system was developed for boxers interested in a training course or sporting event. Through a smart form, participants submit their personal data and immediately receive:

A personalized confirmation message

A PDF with all the event information

Meanwhile, the organizer receives all participant data in a Google Sheet to keep a real-time list of registered athletes

The entire system is automated and scalable for multiple events.
